# GBC

The GBC project is the web application for customization and exporting components.</br>
It allows you to select one of our react components (buttons, forms, etc.), change its appearance and then use it in **your** project.

## Installation

To get started, download the `Library` directory to the `src` folder of your react project.</br>
After installation, it remains only to go to the [website of our application](https://gbc-project.netlify.app/) and get to work.

## Usage

1. Select a component from the list on the left side of the screen.
2. Customize it using the bottom configuration panel.
3. Select the `Export` tab, copy the content, and then paste it where you want in your working project.

**Note: Each time you export a component, do not forget to replace `path/to/Library` with the path to the library in your application.**
